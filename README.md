Now this project is under constructing, so we open it to free product. When we built this project, it will end, so you can use it now, but there are not any finished version, only alpha/beta version, so you can contact us to get free product code. When you get the free product code, you can use it in our future release edition. We will do a "version comparison", so you can contact us, and we will give you a lot of product, not trial product! Please e-mail us, <a href="mailto: admin@frank-ruan.com?subject=Free development product request" target="_blank">Right now</a>, usually i am not online, i only work on holidays, so... You guys know what to do.

If you want to join us, you can just edit this, but when you commit, please add a text:"Developed by " plus your name, not real name, you can just use your nickname, or your Last Name.
